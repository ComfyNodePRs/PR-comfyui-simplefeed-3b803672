# comfyui-simplefeed
A simple image feed for comfyUI which is easily configurable and easily extensible.

Use the filter button to select which nodes write to the feed. 
Under settings, there are options that allow you:
 * Position the feed.
 * Set a max iamge count for the feed.
 * Set oldest to newest or newest to oldest.

Bug reports and feature suggestions welcome, but I would like to keep this lightweight.
